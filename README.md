# language-models

-I used Java language for this project. 

-I think I applied all tasks succesfully for this project. 

-My code can run with following command: 
  Format: java Main datafile outputfile 
  Example: Java Main emails.csv results.txt

-I create the output file and write results in when I run the program. 

-First I write task 3 outputs in file then task 4 and finally task2

-(task 3) I write each sentence and their probabilities end of sentences after "|------->", I put extra line after each sentence for readibility of output file -(task 4) I write each test sentence and their perplexity end of sentencce after "|------->" -(task 2) I write each test sentence and their probability which I calculate with smoothed trigram.

-I separate each task in output file clearly.

-My code's max run time is ten minutes for example dataset(100.000 sentence).
